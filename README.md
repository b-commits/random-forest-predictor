# random-forest-predictor
Python script that tries predicts whether or not a person is depressed using RandomForest algorithm. It's intended to work with b_depressed.csv dataset I found on kaggle, but it should work with pretty much any other set as well. Outputs a handful of .pngs visualising each and every decision tree in whatever directory the script's being called.
